## High Low Chart with Trading Volume

This is a high low chart written in Typescript using the [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/) library. The UI components were created using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

The application uses [React-Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/?from=reactQueryV3&original=https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/) for state management which has featues such as caching and retry mechanism for async calls.

The asynchronous data fetch was done using the [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) library.
